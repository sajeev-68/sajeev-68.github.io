# Emotet - The Final Dive (Part - 3)

## Introduction

Hey Everyone! I know it's been a while (again) but I was kinda stuck and I couldn't find a way forward (I'll explain it better later in this post).
Hey Everyone! I know it's been a while (again) but I was kinda stuck and I couldn't find a way forward (I'll explain it better later in this post).
So this is going to be the final post about the Emotet malware. I plan on exploring different malwares in the future so stay tuned!

## Phase - 4

- In the previous post, I was able to find out the next stage of the malware and we even discussed the various techniques and tricks that this malware used to load it.

- The malware, using reflective code loading, was able to run a different process. I managed to dump the file and fix it to make it into a working executable (If you want to know how to properly dump a PE file from memory watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1k-6_LiSKw)).

### Advanced Dynamic Analysis

- I know this may seem a bit rushed to run right into advanced dynamic analysis without opening it in our decompiler but I believe most of these strings and imports are brought in during runtime so I am making a relatively educated guess to skip advanced static analysis and to move into this phase.

- Also, since this does not spawn a process or do any of the fancy stuff, I can't get a solid breakpoint to jump to, I have to manually analyze this fully.

- How does this work?

- For this, we need to understand about PEB or Program Execution Block and TEB or Thread Execution Block.

#### Tangent-3 PEBs and TEBs

- Think of each process that is currently running as a container with a bunch of threads, these threads are like individual workers that do a single thing within that container/process.

- Now each of the threads has its own storage called the **TLS** or the **Thread Local Storage** and inside this TLS, there is the **TEB** or the **Thread Execution Block**.

- The TEB is a unique structure that contains a pointer to the PEB, so a process has multiple threads each pointing to a single PEB structure. There are other things inside the TEB but these are not relevant to us now.

typedef struct _TEB {

  PVOID ReservedForOle;

```

- As we can see from the structure above, the TEB contains various fields (although most of these are reserved meaning they are for Windows internal use or for future development) the important field for us is the PEB or the ProcessEnvironmentBlock field.

```

- Again, we can observe many "Reserved" fields, but among these, there is the LDR data or the [PEB_LDR_DATA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb_ldr_data) as Windows defines it.

- This LDR structure contains the head of a doubly linked list of all the loaded modules for the process.

```
typedef struct _PEB_LDR_DATA {

  PVOID      Reserved2[3];
  LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderModuleList;
} PEB_LDR_DATA, *PPEB_LDR_DATA;
```
- To access this structure a program can use the `fs` segment register (at an offset of +0x30) in a 32-bit system to retrieve the address of the PEB which is inside the TEB, inside this, at an offset `(PEB base address)+0xC` we can access this PEB_LDR_DATA structure. This is the above structure the PEB_LDR_DATA structure.

- The structure of this linked list is pretty simple
```
typedef struct _LIST_ENTRY {
   struct _LIST_ENTRY *Flink;
   struct _LIST_ENTRY *Blink;
} LIST_ENTRY, *PLIST_ENTRY, *RESTRICTED_POINTER PRLIST_ENTRY;
```
- The above structure is the prototype for the LIST_ENTRY structure, the InMemoryOrderModuleList in the _PEB_LDR_DATA points to the _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY which contains the full dll name and the dll's base address.

    ULONG TimeDateStamp;
} LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, *PLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY;
```

How would this look?

Step 1 - use the fs register to retrieve the PEB structure `mov eax, [fs:eax + 0x30]` \
Step 2 - retrieve the LDR structure from the PEB structure `mov eax, [eax + 0xC]` \
Step 3 - retrieve the InMemoryOrderModuleList from the LDR structure `mov ebx, [eax + 0x14]`\

Step 4 - now we can obtain the information from the LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY structure 

- Now that we know how we can "walk" PEB to retrieve functions while evading static analysis we can examine our function.

### Phase - 4(Cont...)

- Going into the function we can see a lot of data being stored in the stack, maybe these are addresses that contain the necessary functions?

![PEB-function2](/assets/img/blog_imgs/77.png)

- Inside the first function we can notice the familiar pattern of events as discussed in our Tangent-3 first we see a move from `fs:[30]` to `eax`, a.k.a, the PEB structure.

- It's kind of hard to explain what happens here but basically the function retrieves a bunch of functions from inside the ntdll.dll file and loops through, until it gets a certain function, like ZwUnmapViewOfSection and RtlComputeCrc32 etc. after getting these functions these addresses are loaded into a specific location in the memory where they can be called.

- The data that was transferred into the stack were like hashes or keys. First, it gets a certain function from the ntdll file, calculates the hash by multiplying with 1003F and adding the first byte of the function name to the multiplied number every time, until it reaches the end of the function name (I know this is a confusing explanation, but basically it calculates a hash of sort).

- After this, the calculated hash is XOR'ed with a key to get the final hash. This key/hash is then compared to the data that was transferred into the stack and if a data matches the key it gets the function and stores the address in a pre-determined location.

- Another important thing is how these strings are retrieved we create a heap and then retrieve the string from some other place in the memory. After completing any operations the created heap is destroyed.

- As to how these strings are stored in memory, the program utilizes snwprintf to store the created string in the memory.

- For example, the program creates the string with the format specifier and "%x" along with the command line parameter, with this string the program uses snwprintf to write this into the memory so that it can be compared to the string we retrieve from the GetCommandLineW. This is done in order to know if this process was started with the correct cmd-line arg.

- Before going into the default function, let me explain how this is structured

- In order to get into function1 we can either run the program with its cmd line arg in x32dbg or we can simply make it so that the program thinks it has the proper cmdline arg. by making the lstrcmpiW command return true.

- I chose the second method, as we can see in the above image, the lstrcmpiW returns -1, 0 or 1, if it returns 0, it means that both the provided strings are the same, that is the desired output for us, so we let the function run, modify the `eax` to 0 to make sure it does not take the jump below and instead calls the function.

- Et voilÃ ! we are inside the main function, we can notice a GetTickCount this is typically done in order to suss out the possibility of the program being run under a debugger, so we basically get the TickCount at a certain point, let's say *T1* and then we do a bunch of operations, after this we get the TickCount again, *T2* so if *T2 - T1* is a big number we can safely say that the program is running under a debugger, else continue the normal execution.

- Here however the GetTickCount does not store this output anywhere and instead divides it by 4000 and moves the remainder to esi, I do not really understand the purpose of this but, I will do some further research on this later.

- Going forward, most of the string operations are done in this manner.

- This was the reason why we could not observe any valid strings during static analysis.

- This string is used to create a mutex, a mutex is a synchronization object used by Windows, what it basically does is, when a thread uses this object its state is set to signaled so that no other object can use this.

- This takes a different path compared to the first time execution as the string compare with the executable path returns true.

- However, since we are executing the program from our local copy, we need to make sure that lstrcmpiW returns 0 this makes it so that the program thinks that it is the copy from the SYSWOW64 directory.

- After this, we can see that the program imports several libraries.

- The way the program moves through different states is really interesting, after completing a stage the program changes the `eax` register and using a switch-case like structure the malware decides which stage to execute next. all of this have to be done after the synchronization event that we created is available.

- After getting the all the programs. the malware sends some encrypted data to a C2 server. I am unsure if this encryption is standard practice or not. but the data that is sent over is not the problem, it is the servers that gets this data.

- all the servers that receive this data, the C2 servers, are all probably shutdown, so getting to the next stage is not possible. This is the major problem that I have been facing. Without these servers being up, the next stage of the malware is not obtainable.

- Using FakeNet, we can see the data which is sent to this C2 server.

- The program, runs continously in the background, sending data to a bunch IPs all presumably C2 servers.

- After sending the data, the malware receives a file back and decrypts it using the hash we created, if the program recives the correct file it proceeds to create a new process using the recived data. But I cannot confirm this without the proper response file.

- This concludes my analysis of the Emotet malware.

### Future works

- Anyways, I noticed a major flaw in getting malware samples from the internet, these samples are often well analyzed and documented. Because of this the C2 servers are shutdown(for good reasons) so getting the next stage is next to impossible.

- To combat this I am collecting my own samples using a honeypot.

- I have set up a honeypot(Tpot) in google cloud. This has a well developed interface along with a live attack map(how cool is that??!)

- I have obtained several samples of malware both for linux and windows(btw this honeypot has been up for only about 2 weeks). Although most of them are wannacry/wannacrypt, which is surprising, its a pretty old malware and i did not exepect it to be sitll is use. In the linux side of things I am woefully under-equipped to analyze malwares but, it does seem interesting and worth giving a try, most samples are multiverze or xorddos.

- I also have simple python script to get the details of the files that are captured in the honeypot, using virustotal([link](https://github.com/sajeev-68/vt-dionaea-scanner)), it only scans the dionea honeypot directory but I plan on adding other directories in the future as well.

- I plan on either analyzing the linux or the wanncry malware next so stay tuned and thank you for taking your time to read this!
